In the darkest times, stars shine the brightest,
When hope seems lost, it's not gone entirely.
Keep moving forward with faith in your heart,
And the dawn will rise after every night.
Success is not final, failure is not fatal,
It is the courage to continue that counts.
Each step forward, no matter how small,
Is progress toward your greatest goal.
Everything popular is wrong.
Everything popular is wrong.
Everything popular is wrong.
